# VTP
Vehicle Trajectory Prediction with Deep Learning Models


## STA-LSTM: An LSTM model with spatial-temporal attention mechanisms
STA-LSTM achieves comparable prediction performance against other state-of-the-art models (e.g., conv-LSTM [1], naive LSTM), and also explains the influence of historical trajectories and neighboring vehicles on the target vehicle.

| Models     | RMSE per prediction time step |
| ---      | ---       |
| physics-based model |          |
| naive LSTM     |         |
| SA-LSTM     |         |
| CS-LSTM     |         |
| STA-LSTM     |         |
