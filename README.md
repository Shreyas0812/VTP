# VTP
Vehicle Trajectory Prediction with Deep Learning Models

# conv_social_comments: 
code from the paper 'Nachiket Deo and Mohan M. Trivedi,"Convolutional Social Pooling for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction." CVPRW, 2018' with comments added.

# HA-LSTM:
code of hieratical-attention LSTM for vehicle trajectory prediction (time-step level and vehicle-level attention mechanisms)

# Data:
NGSIM data-the same processing procedure from the convolutional social pooling paper is followed. The training/val/testing datasets can be dowloaed from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dFMpX8HeCradMaCh4h0bD60h8k3M65Fw)
